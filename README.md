# Module-10-Challenge

## Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

- I was able to complete this part successfully with what I learned in the class and the provided hints in the starter file. Some of my comments are in the `climate.ipynb` file.

## Part 2: Design Your Climate App

- I utilized the most recent date found in the part directly before for the routes that were required to retrieve only the last 12 months of data, which are 'precipitation' and 'tobs' route.

- The instruction about what data to retrieve for the 'stations' route was not clear to me. So I chose to provide the jsonified data of all the stations' information in the 'station' table in the `hawaii.sqlite` database.

- For the 'Dynamic Route' section, I had trouble converting the user-entered start date and end date to date objects in order to pass into the query for needed data. I was able to solve this problem by consulting ChatGPT.
